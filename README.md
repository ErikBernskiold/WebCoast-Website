== WebCoast Website Repository ==

WebCoast is a yearly community-driven unconference in Gothenburg, Sweden
with a strong focus on web and communication.

Since everything is built on a community effort, so should the website,
which is why it is outsourced here on GitHub.

Because of the way we maintain the site, this repository basically just
has any custom plugins and the custom theme. The rest of WordPress
and its plugins are not under version control.
